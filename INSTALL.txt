Install this software is quite complex and it is not recommended. Instead of that, please refer to the vms (Virtual
Machine System) project and follow the instructions to have a virtual machine running with all the software properly
installed and configured:

To have it installed out of the virtual machine, please have a look at the install scripts and do the same operations
manually. No further documentation is provided.
