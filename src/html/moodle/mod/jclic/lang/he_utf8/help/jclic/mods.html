<ul>
<p><a href="http://clic.xtec.cat" target="_blank">JClic</a> is a project of the Catalan Ministry of  Education. It consists of  a set of open source software applications that allow for the creation of several types of multimedia educational activities: puzzles, association games, text activities, crosswords, wordsearch games and  more. Besides, the <a href="http://clic.xtec.net/db/listact_ca.jsp" target="_blank">ClicZone</a> offers a repository  where more than a thousand activities are displayed. It has been created by teachers and other professionals who  want to share their work with others.</p>

<p>This module will show teachers how to add JClick activities to any course and how to track pupils' results  (time spent on each of the activities, number of tries, score...) </p>
