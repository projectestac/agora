<p>
If this option is enabled, the order to show the sections and questions of the assessment will be different for each student.<br>
Therefore, to show some or all of the sections and questions of the assessment in a different order for each student it's necessary to edit the assessment with the Editor and indicate the sections and/or questions that may appear at random.<br>
To achieve this it has been added to the sections and questions editing screens of the Editor the <b>Order</b> parameter to indicate, one by one, the sections and questions that can appear anywhere in the assessment (by selecting the option <b>The section/question can be displayed in ANY POSITION inside the assessment</b>).
