This is a WIRIS quizzes feature for enhanced math and science questions.</p>
<p>
If activated, in the answer form appears a WIRIS CAS applet where students can perform auxiliar computations.
In the case of <em>Essay</em> type questions, you may indicate that the applet replaces the HTML editor, so that the student must respond in the same WIRIS CAS.
In <em>Short answer</em> type questions and if the option <em>Formula Editor </em> is choosen, will appear a button to copy the result of calculations into the formula editor.
