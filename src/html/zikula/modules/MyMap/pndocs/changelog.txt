====
2008-08-23 by quan
- included latest mapstraction.js
- added scribite support
- fixed bug for users not having js enabled
2008-08-18 by quan:
- removed Content plugin - this was very buggy. Please use
  Multihook and the MyMap needle to integrate maps into
  Content. Maybe another plugin will follow later....
2008-08-17 by quan:
- removed hook api and hook functionality and:
- added needle support for MultiHook - it is simplier and 
  better than a hook!
  
2008-02-28 by trudero:
- Updated "mapstraction.js"
  Including fix to hide markers without removing tracks.
- Added asynchronous items download (AJAX/JSON)
  Currently disabled (commented) out because
  - download breaks if JSON exceedes ~4KB
    => sequentially downloading multiple parts
  - it is slower than the direcly integrated code
