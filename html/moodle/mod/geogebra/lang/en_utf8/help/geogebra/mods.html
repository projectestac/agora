<p><a href="http://www.geogebra.org" target="_blank">GeoGebra</a> is a free and multi-platform dynamic mathematics software for all levels of education that joins geometry, algebra, tables, graphing, statistics and calculus in one easy-to-use package.</p>
<p>
Therefore, the <a href="http://www.gencat.cat/ensenyament/" target="_blank">Departament of Education of Catalonia</a> in collaboration with the <a href="http://acgeogebra.cat/" target="_blank">Catalan Association of GeoGebra</a> (ACG) and the GeoGeobra development team have implemented this module that allows the incorporation of GeoGebra activities in Moodle. Its main features are:
<ul>  
    <li>Allows embedding easily GeoGebra activities in some Moodle course.</li>
    <li>Facilitates students tracing because it stores the score, date, duration and construction of each of the attempts made ​​by the users.</li>
    <li>Students can save the state of the activities to continue them later.</li>
</ul>
