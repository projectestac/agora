This is a WIRIS quizzes feature for enhanced math and science questions.

<p>
To enable this option <emph>Formula editor</emph>must also be enabled. If activated, the solution ceases to be a single value or formula. Instead, it is a set of pairs <emph>variable=value</emph>. These variables are among those defined in the algorithm. The <emph>Answer</emph> field is then a space-separated list of variables.
