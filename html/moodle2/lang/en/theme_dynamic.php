If you want to modify this theme, we recommend that you first duplicate it then rename it before making your changes. This will prevent your customized theme from being overwritten by future Moodle upgrades, and you will still have the original files if you make a mess. More information on modifying themes can be found in the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Theme">MoodleDocs</a>.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>This theme is based on Moodle Splash theme and it is further customized by 3i Logic.</p></div></div>';
