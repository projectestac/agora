<h2>About</h2>
<p>Aardvark Post-IT is a three column fluid-width theme for Moodle 2.3.1+ by Mary Evans, based on the original Aardvark 2.1 theme by Shauun Daubney.</p>
<h2>Tweaks</h2>
<p>If you want to modify this theme, we recommend that you first duplicate it, then rename it before making your changes. This will prevent your customised theme from being overwritten by future Moodle upgrades, and you\'ll still have the original files if you make a mess. More information on modifying themes can be found in the <a href="http://docs.moodle.org/en/Theme">MoodleDocs</a>.</p>';
