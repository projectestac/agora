    The original Moodle 1.9 version of Custom corners was created by <strong>Urs Hunkler, <a href="http://www.unodo.de">unodo</a></strong>. This Moodle 2.2 version makes use of a technique described by
    Roger Johansson - see
    "<a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200506/customising_custom_corners_and_borders/">customising_custom_corners_and_borders</a>"
    However, the Moodle 2.2 version of Custom Corners theme does not use all the JavaScript mentioned by Roger Johansson.
