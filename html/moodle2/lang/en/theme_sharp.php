It makes use of custom menus that appear above the site title on every page, giving it a user friendly structure. It comes in a variety of colors and is designed to provide a lower contrast interface for reading while maintaining clear visibility.  It also includes a basic settings page allowing you to change your custom logo, link color, add a tagline above the site name on the front page, and add text to the footer.</p><h2>Parents</h2><p>This theme is built upon both Base and Canvas, two parent themes included in the Moodle core. If you wish to modify aspects of this theme beyond the settings offered, we advise creating a new  theme using this theme, Base and Canvas all as parents so updates to any of those themes in the core will find their way into your new theme.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>This theme is based on fusion themes, it was originally created by Digital Nature(hello@digitalnature.ro) before being ported to Moodle by Patrick Malley (patrick@newschoollearning.com). Sharp was created by 3i Logic.</div></div>';
