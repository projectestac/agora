<h3>About</h3>
<p>buckle is a modified Moodle bootstrap theme which inherits styles and renderers from its parent theme.</p>
<h3>Parents</h3>
<p>This theme is based upon the Bootstrap theme, which was created for Moodle 2.5, with the help of:<br>
Stuart Lamour, Mark Aberdour, Paul Hibbitts, Mary Evans.</p>
<p>It also builds on the work of the Clean theme by Mary Evans and uses the responsive pagelayout structure from Krystle - orginally used from Danny Wahls Zebra theme and based on the Matthew James Taylor Holy Grail layouts</p>
<h3>Theme Credits</h3>
<p>See above for credits for parent themes and work built on from other themes - All credit goes to those developers, while all errors in teh theme I keep for myself!</p>
