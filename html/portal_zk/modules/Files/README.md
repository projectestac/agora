Files module
============
Files module 1.0.3 **for Zikula 1.3.x**

  - The module Files **allow users to manage their own files**. They can upload, rename, delete, zip and unzip files and folders. The users can decide if a folder is **public or private**. If a folder is set as public files stored in it are accessible trough the file *file.php*.
  - Administrators can set different **quotas** for different groups of users.
  - The module needs a folder where to store the users' files. In preference this folder must be located out of the public HTML. This folder (may be the same zkdata folder). Files folder contains the users folders and other content (if it is zkdata, all the files of other modules).
  - **Administrators also can manage the entire Files folder**.
  - Module has a **xinha and tinymce plugins** for **Scribite 4.3** and for **Scribite 5.x** to easily **insert links and images** from the public folders.

Installing Files
================

Copying files
-------------

  1. Download the repo form [github](https://github.com/zikula-modules/Files/archive/master.zip).
  2. Extract files and copy them to *path_to_Zikula_root/modules/Files*
  3. Copy *path_to_Zikula_root/modules/Files/Resources/extras/file.php* to *path_to_Zikula_root/file.php*
  4. If you use Scribite, you can use xinha and tinymce plugins. You must copy files from *path_to_Zikula_root/modules/Files/Resources/namePlugin*. Read README.md file and use the right scribite version (v4 or v5).
  5. Delete *path_to_Zikula_root/modules/Files/Resources* folder

Module configuration
--------------------

  1. Simply install the module and run it.
  2. Default configuration use *zikulaDataFolder* to store files. Then module creates *usersFiles* (into *zikulaDataFolder*) to store users files. There will be one folder for each user (for example *zikulaDataFolder/usersFiles/a/admin*)
  3. The users folder (*usersFiles*) is easily changeable from module administration.
  4. You can change the main folder (default value *zikulaDataFolder*) in *config.php*
      - You can define *$ZConfig['FilesModule']['folderPath']* with an alternative route (the path needs an real and writeable folder)
      - For multisites (*$ZConfig['Multisites']['multi']* = 1) you need a more complex configuration. Then you must define two more vars. The path will be *$ZConfig['Multisites']['filesRealPath'] . '/' . $ZConfig['Multisites']['siteFilesFolder']*
  5. If you use [Ã€gora project](https://github.com/projectestac/agora), you must define *$ZConfig['iwmodules']['agora'] = true* to use agora functions
  6. You can use Files plugin in you html editor. Then write Scribite info. You can use version 4.3 or 5.x (or both versions, cloning scribite module)

Scribite plugins
------------------

  1. Like other plugins, admin have to go to *Administration-Scribite-EditorConfig-Xinha/TinyMCE* and check *Files* plugin
  2. Then, you will see a *paper clip* button in your editor

Notes
-----

  - Using the default configuration (*folderPath = zikulaDataFolder*), admin can manage other modules files.
