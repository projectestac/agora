Formicula 3.0.0 user manual
-------------------------
manual for Formicula v.2 by Jim Hadfield and Frank Schummertz
manual for Formicula >v.2: Frank Schummertz
     
Formicula supports an infinite number of contact forms with an infinite number 
of custom fields (ok, infinite as long as you have enough server memory).

Requirements
------------
Formicula 2.0 requires Zikula 1.0 or later. It *will not* run
with earlier versions - sorry. Use Formicula < 2.0 instead.
For creating captchas you need PHP compiled with the GD graphics library.

Installation
------------
1. Extract the files to your Zikula directory.
2. Load, initialize and activate the module in the admin section.
3. During installation, Formicula tries to create a directory formicula_cache containing an
   index.html and a .htaccess file.
   If this fails (most probably when safemode is set to 'on' in your PHP environment or the zTemp
   directory is outside your web root), you will be notified and have to create them on your own:
   a) Create a directory formicula_cache in your temporary directory (most likely zTemp) and make it 
      writable for the web server (chmod 777)
   b) Add an empty index.html file (you can copy the one from modules/Formicula if you want).
      although this is not really needed for Apache-based webservers where we use the .htaccess
      in the zTemp to avoid access to the subdirectorys, it is needed on webserver who do not
      support .htaccess.
   c) Create a .htacess in formicula_cache containing the following lines to allow access to the
      images created for the captcha:
      SetEnvIf Request_URI "\.gif$" object_is_gif=gif
      SetEnvIf Request_URI "\.png$" object_is_png=png
      SetEnvIf Request_URI "\.jpg$" object_is_jpg=jpg
      Order deny,allow
      Deny from all
      Allow from env=object_is_gif
      Allow from env=object_is_png
      Allow from env=object_is_jpg
4. Create some contact names/topics with respective email adresses	in the Formicula admin setion.
   Upon installation, Formicula creates a default contact with the admins mail address.
5. Add a basic permission rule, e.g.
   unreg. users (group)  |  Formicula::  |  .*  |  comment
   This enables unregistered users to use all existing forms. In a default installation
   the users group has a generic comment permission to do the same.
6. Add a link to your main menu with: {Formicula} (using [Formicula] will not work!)
   This uses form 0. To call a specific form id use
   index.php?name=Formicula&form=<formid>
   e.g. index.php?name=Formicula&form=5 to use form #5
In the distribution package you will find two sample forms 0 and 1, 
0 is a normal contact form and form #1 is for filing an online job application.

Configuration
-------------
Show xxx: quick configuration enable/disable some fields in the userform. THese fields may be
(read: surely will be) removed in future versions.
Send confirmation email to user: Tick this to send an confirmation mail to the user  	
directory for uploaded files: Uploaded files get stored here. Make sure this directory is secured with a
.htacess file otherwise someone can upload malicious files and execute them!
Delete file after sending: does what it says when ticked.
Activate spamcheck: shows a little captcha in the form

Contacts
--------
Each contact consists of several information:

Contact name or Topic: The name that is shown to the user in the form, e.g. Webmaster 	
Email: The email to send the data to	
Public: tick this to make the contact available	for use.
Sender name: senders name as used in the users confirmation mail	
Sender email: senders email address as used in the users confirmation mail, e.g noreply@example.com	
Subject: enter a static subject or use these placeholders:
    * %s = sitename
    * %l = slogan
    * %u = site url
    * %c = contact name
    * %n<num> = user defined field name <num>
    * %d<num> = user defined field data <num>
 
Templates
---------
Everything you want to do with the form is handled in the templates.
The '#' at the beginning of the template designates the number of form.

The templates for the forms are named as follows:

The form with the input fields:  #_userform.html
The page with the confirmation after submitting the data:  #_userconfirm.html
The page with error messages after submitting data:  #_usererror.html
The user's confirmation mail in text format:  #_usermail.txt
The user's confirmation mail in html format:  #_usermail.html
The admin mail in text format:  #_adminmail.txt
The admin mail in html format:  #_adminmail.html
This is the email that the admin gets after the user sends submits the userform.

Note: the email format can be chosen by using a dropdown like
			
<select name="userformat">
<option value="html">{gt text='Html'}</option>
<option value="plain">{gt text='Plain text'}</option>
</select>

or if you want to force the type of email, you can use a hidden field in the form
			
<input type="hidden" name="userformat" value="html" /> 

If you do not want to send a confirmation email to the user for a certain form, set
userformat to none:
 
<input type="hidden" name="userformat" value="none" /> 

This overrides the setting in the configuration.

Standard Fields
---------------
The standard fields to be used in forma are

uname: the users name (mandatory)
uemail: the users name (mandatory)
url: the users homepage (optional)
location, phone, company: these are obvious... (optional)
comment: normally a textarea for entering free text. Since 0.6 this is not longer 
a mandatory field! HTML is stripped from the comments to avoid spam. In addition, the
comment is send to Zikula's internal censor function. If the result differs from the 
original comment, the submission is also treated as spam and not sent. This results
in an error message. 
captcha: mandatory if spamcheck feature is enabled,see 0_userform.html for an example

Custom Fields
-------------
You can add as many custom fields to your form as you want. 
This makes it easy to create e.g. an online job application form if needed.

This makes it necessary to send certain information from the form page to the module.
The custom fields are numbered (# in the following examples), starting at 0.

These are:
  
* custom#name (hidden field) name of the custom field
  can be used in the confirmation email
  
* custom#mandatory (hidden field) set to 1 if this is a mandatory field.
  Formicula checks this and shows an errormessage when this field is not filled

* custom#data (any kind of input field) the data with #=number.
  the payload

The hidden field numFields for the number of custom fields used is not longer 
necessary. Just make sure that your custom field numbering consistent. This 
means 1-2-3-4-5 is ok while 1-2-7-8-9 will not work. Formicula reads all custom
fields until it finds a gap of three digits. In the second example above this 
means it reads custom field 1 and 2, fails reading 3,4 and 5 and then stops
and does not care about others that may have been sent (or not).

Example:

<label class="mandatory" for="custom0data">{gt text='foobar'}</label><br />
<input type="hidden" name="custom0name" value="{gt text='foobar'}" />
<input type="hidden" name="custom0mandatory" value="1" />
<input type="text" name="custom0data" id="custom0data" size="35" maxLength="80" value="" />

Permissions
-----------
To use a form you need the right to COMMENT.

Unregistered   |   Formicula::  |  .*   |  comment
all unregistered users are allowed to use all forms and write to all contacts

Unregistered   |   Formicula::  |  0::  |  comment
all unregistered users are allowed to use form 0 with all existing contacts.
	
Users   |   Formicula::   |  1:(2|3):  |  comment
all members of the group Users are allowed to use form 1 and write to contact 2 and 3.
    
Use external information in the forms
-------------------------------------
You can use external information in the form by sending them in the url used to call
the form.

These data are send in an associative array addinfo where the key is the name.

With

index.php?name=Formicula&form=2&addinfo[tid]=4&addinfo[pid]=17

you send two different information to the form 2 which can used in the userform template (in
this example 2_userform.html) with

{$addinfo.tid}  => 4
{$addinfo.pid}  => 17

As you can see you can use this to e.g. load data from Pagesetter in the userform template.

Client side input validation
----------------------------
The supplied templates use a prototype.js-based input validation. If you do not want 
to use this, simply remove the javascript from the templates.

A detailed explanation how to use this feature can be found at
http://tetlaw.id.au/view/blog/really-easy-field-validation-with-prototype/

Captcha
-------
The simplecaptcha plugins adds an image with a very basic math equation (2 number from 1 to 2 
and either +, - or *) to the form if the spam check is enabled. If the user enters a wrong
value, Formicula redirects back to the page where it came from.

Formicula tries to create images in this order:
gif
jpg
png
If all these image types are not supported by your server, captchas are deactivated, in this
case Formicula turns the configuration option "Activate spamcheck" off.
Please refer to http://php.net/manual/en/ref.image.php for more information.

Formicula also supports zTemp-directorys located outside the websites root directory. In this case
(when the temp directory points to an absolute path) the image is deliverd by a internal 
function and not linked directly.
