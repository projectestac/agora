Upgrade instructions for CKEditor 4 package
============================================

1. Download from vendor website using builder:
http://ckeditor.com/builder
- choose FULL preset.
- at that point without selecting any optional plugins (right panel);
- select all available languages;
- Leave Skin as default (currently Moono);
- Choose optimized package
This is base package, and in next step will add more plugins and skins. 
--> It is important for CKEditor to work normally to use ckeditor.js from this download.

2. Download with builder again, with all optional plugins selected and optional skin (kama) selected.
- from this download copy optional plugins to first downloaded package, also optional skin. Attention for respective directories.
- check plugins directory for missing optional plugins, and if some are missing - download manually them and copy in plugins directory.

3. Add custconfig.js from previous version to main package directory for updated version.
